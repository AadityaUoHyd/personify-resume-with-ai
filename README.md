# personify-resume-with-ai
This project, **Personify Resume with AI**, is an AI-powered resume-building web application that leverages **Spring AI** on the backend and **React** on the frontend. It integrates **Mistral AI** for generating personalized resume content based on user descriptions. Authentication is still pending and I am suppose to build, it'll be handled in future using **Spring Security with JWT and Google OAuth**. The backend, built with **Spring Boot**, this project as of requires no db as we are not saving anything. This system dynamically processes user inputs to generate structured, ATS-friendly resumes. With **REACT** for frontend efficiency, the app ensures a seamless user experience. Future enhancements may include real-time AI-powered resume analysis with scores, and job-matching features. ðŸš€
